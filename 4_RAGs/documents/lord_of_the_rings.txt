Book One: The Fellowship of the Ring

Chapter 1: A Long-expected Party

When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. The Gaffer, the gardener, was one of those who had been specially chosen to assist with the preparations, and he and his helpers were busy with all sorts of odd jobs in the garden. The hobbits, who were short and stout in stature, with round faces and bright, inquisitive eyes, had never before seen such a bustling, curious crowd in their peaceful town. 

It was indeed a day of great significance, and Bilbo had decided that he would leave the Shire for good, vanishing as mysteriously as he had appeared. In his old age, Bilbo had grown tired of the same routine, and was looking for an adventure that would carry him beyond the borders of the Shire and into lands unknown. He was a hobbit of great wealth, and his decision to leave a fortune behind had left many wondering what his motives were.

But for Bilbo Baggins, there was only one thing that mattered: adventure. He was determined to begin a new chapter in his life, one filled with mystery, danger, and excitement. His journey, however, would not be an easy one. The fate of Middle-earth itself would soon be intertwined with the choices he would make on his travels.
